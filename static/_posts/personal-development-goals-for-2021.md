What do I want to learn in 2021?

- Learn to write idiomatic Python: My background is primarily C# development, but my new job does most of their work in Python. Anyone can write Python code, but not everyone can write _good_ Python code. In 2021, I want to become just as well-versed in Python patterns and language features as I am in C#.

- Gain a stringer foundation in DevOps and Infrastructure principles: My title is "Software Developer", but for a while now I have been interested in DevOps. I don't think I want it to be my full-time job, but understanding infrastructure and DevOps tooling seems to me like a valuable tool. A developer with a solid understanding of both development and infrastructure should be able to make more educated architectural decisions, reason better about system-level efficiency (that is, price vs. performance), and improve the developer experience. Devs that understand DevOps and infrastructure can more effectively separate marketing material from real, useful features (at least, I think so anyway). 

- Write more, and write better...: This goal is a means to an end. I am not interested in amassing a large body of works, or even writing material that is particularly useful to the general public. I want to learn to articulate my thoughts more completely through the written word, and writing more often feel like the best way to practice that. In 2021 I want to be more consistent in my writing, and to take it less seriously.

- ...but also learn to speak: Speaking at a conference is on my career bucket-list. I don't foresee that happening in 2021, but that doesn't mean I can't take steps to get there. In 2021, I want to take up more opportunities to speak in front of a crowd (or over Zoom, either works). I don't even care what the subject is, I just want to speak more for the learning experience. Maybe I will read a book about rhetoric or something too.
