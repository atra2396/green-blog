## The Situation
I have the good fortune of working with some talented software developers at my current job. People with a healthy curiosity, good ideas, and the skill to act on them. People who care about the work that they do, and are dedicated to the craft of software development.

Our company also has a provision for "innovation time", which we call "Tinker Time". It's based off the concept of "[20% time]"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project), with a few rules:
- Tinker Time grants each member of the engineering team (both dev and QA) 2 days a month to research or experiment with any software-related topic, which doesn't necessarily have to be related to anything in our current tech stack. The 2 days can be banked for a month, so if someone chooses they can take 4 days every other month.
- Even if one's Tinker Time doesn't yield an artifact, a presentation must be given to the whole engineering team (about 20 people at the time of writing this) sometime afterwards. It doesn't have to be long, typically between 15 and 30 minutes. A PowerPoint is required if there's nothing to demo.
- Tinker Time can be used to pay down tech debt. If it's used to improve an existing product, then no presentation is required. Anything that is worked on must undergo the usual testing and deployment process in order to make it into production.

So, given the existence of both of these things, we should have a good handle on innovation, right?



Wrong.

## The Problem

- Management: unknown stance, passing up the chain
- Existing policy: a good provision for experimentation
    - ...but we're still at a standstill!
- Observation: locked in a Prisoner's Dilemma: no common knowledge, best for nobody to risk getting punished
- Solution: Guild up
    - What is a guild?
    - SAFe: Communities of Practice
    - Commit to planning
        - Velocity vs. Innovation: benefits we've seen
