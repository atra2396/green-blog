## The Situation
I have the good fortune of working with some talented software developers at my current job. People with a healthy curiosity, good ideas, and the skill to act on them. People who care about the work that they do, and are dedicated to the craft of software development.

Our company has an existing provision for "innovation time", which we call "Tinker Time". It's loosely based off Atlassian's [20% time experiment](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/archives/20_time_experiment), with a few key differences:
- Tinker Time grants each member of the engineering team (both dev and QA) 2 days a month to research or experiment with any software-related topic, which doesn't necessarily have to be related to anything in our current tech stack. The 2 days can be banked for a month, so if someone chooses they can take 4 days every other month.
- Even if one's Tinker Time doesn't yield an artifact, a presentation must be given to the whole engineering team (about 20 people at the time of writing this) sometime afterwards.

- Management: unknown stance, passing up the chain
- Existing policy: a good provision for experimentation
    - ...but we're still at a standstill!
- Observation: locked in a Prisoner's Dilemma: no common knowledge, best for nobody to risk getting punished
- Solution: Guild up
    - What is a guild?
    - SAFe: Communities of Practice
    - Commit to planning
